                <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                <p>CLOVE, pronounced ‘see love’, is a community engagement application for backyard gardeners and lovers of fresh local produce.</p>
                <p>Standing for Community - Local, Organic, Vegetable, Exchange, CLOVE seeks to connect community members through an online interface.</p>
                <p>Producers can list their harvests for others to see, and consumers can use the interface to search for local produce. Additionally, you’ll find links to resources that can put you in touch with local charities that accept food donations, as well as food banks that are active in your area.</p>
                <p>Helping communities share their resources through exchange in their local communities prevents food waste and helps to support local economies and charities.</p>
