## Short Description 

CLOVE, pronounced ‘see love’, is a community engagement application for backyard gardeners and lovers of fresh local produce.Producers can list their harvests for others to see, and consumers can use the interface to search for local produce. Additionally, you’ll find links to resources that can put you in touch with local charities that accept food donations, as well as food banks that are active in your area.

## Using the App Locally

To begin installing the application on your local device, first clone the repository to your desired directory

```
git clone https://github.com/PN-Barnes/CLOVE.git
```
Next, open up the folder and create a .env file in the root directory. Inside the file, fill in the following:

```
DB_NAME='clove_db'
DB_USER='root'
DB_PASSWORD='<your mySQL password goes here>'
```

Once that's done, install the required packages using <b>npm i</b>

After that, source the clove database using the following commands.

```
mysql -u root -p
source ./db/schema.sql
```
Finally, run the following two node commands to load the application:

```
npm run seed
npm run start
```

You can now go to http://localhost:3001 and browse our application!
